# Iterative Hypothesis Interview

An agent skill for customer development interviews. Helps users discover what to build by reconstructing real workflows and pain points — not by asking "what do you want?"

Based on the [Iterative Hypothesis](https://asmartbear.com/customer-development) approach by Jason Cohen.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add berto-dev/iterative-hypothesis-interview
```

## What it does

Instead of asking users what agent they want (they don't know), this skill guides AI agents through a structured 3-round interview:

1. **Understand their world** — Ask about actual day-to-day work, not hypotheticals
2. **Dig into surprises** — Follow unexpected threads to find real opportunities
3. **Propose hypotheses** — Frame agent concepts as testable hypotheses tied to specific pain points

## When it triggers

- "Interview me"
- "Help me figure out what to build"
- "What should I build?"
- "Discover ideas"
- Any customer development or discovery context

## Compatible agents

Works with any agent that supports the Skills standard: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Windsurf, Goose, and more.
